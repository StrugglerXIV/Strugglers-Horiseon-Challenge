# Horiseon Landing Page

## Description

This is a project that I was able to complete thanks to the lessons I've been taking in the UCF coding Bootcamp.
This project is due to be delivered on Monday 02/17/2023.
Following proper guidelines and putting in the work necessary I hope this will fullfill the requirements set by the challenge.
